README – Essential Questions Reflection
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Understanding and implementing user needs is a fundamental aspect of effective software development. I begin by engaging with stakeholders to gather detailed requirements that reflect their expectations and business goals. Translating these requirements into “user stories” allows me to capture specific functionalities from the user’s perspective. Each user story serves as a concise, goal-oriented narrative that outlines what the user wants to achieve and why. This approach promotes clarity, ensures alignment with user expectations, and provides a clear development path that guides implementation. Additionally, user stories support prioritization and continuous feedback, helping maintain focus on delivering valuable features.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
My approach to software development is rooted in Agile methodologies, which emphasize iterative progress, stakeholder collaboration, and adaptability. I begin by breaking down the project into smaller, manageable tasks and organizing them within a structured product backlog. During each sprint, I focus on delivering functional increments that can be tested and reviewed. I rely on Agile processes such as sprint planning, daily stand-up meetings, sprint reviews, and retrospectives to foster transparency, continuous improvement, and team engagement. Moving forward, I aim to incorporate these practices into my future development work to maintain flexibility, enhance team collaboration, and deliver high-quality solutions that respond to evolving user needs.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being an effective team member in software development extends beyond technical contributions. It involves clear communication, mutual respect, accountability, and a commitment to shared goals. A strong team member actively participates in discussions, offers constructive feedback, and supports others in overcoming challenges. They take ownership of their work, meet deadlines, and adapt to team dynamics with a solution-focused mindset. Fostering a positive and collaborative environment not only improves productivity but also contributes to the overall success of the project. I strive to embody these qualities by consistently demonstrating professionalism, empathy, and a strong work ethic in all team interactions.
